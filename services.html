								<h2>Abrasive Blasting</h2>
								<div class="abrasive-info">
									<p>Abrasive blasting or sandblasting is a cleaning or surface preparation procedure by spraying abrasive media at high velocities.It is like a strong cleaning process using tiny particles to remove dirt, rust, or old paint from surfaces, leaving them clean and surface-prepared to receive new coatings or finishes.Clean thoroughly along with blasting profile from Sa1-Sa3.
								<br>Surface preparation procedure mechanically by bombarding/spraying.<br><b>Sweep Blasting :</b>Also known as brush or whip abrasive blasting, is a gentle abrasive blasting process used to prepare surfaces, particularly galvanized steel, for painting or other coatings.<br>
							</p>
								</div>
								            <div id="hotdip">
							<h2>Hot Dip Galvanizing </h2>
							<p>
										Hot dip galvanizing is a galvanizing process by which the steel is coated with a layer of zinc to be corrosion-resistant.  
								Hot dip galvanizing is an economic and efficient method of protection of iron and steel from rust and corrosion, prolonging its life, and reducing maintenance costs.
							</p>
							
								<p>
									Hot Dip Galvanizing to BS EN ISO 1461:2022 and ASTM A123/A153 standards. The process includes Garnet-Grit mix blasting, acid pickling and galvanizing by dipping in molten zinc at 445°C - 455°C.

								<h2>Fire Proof Painting</h2>
								<p>Fireproof painting, or fire-resistant painting or intumescent painting, is a specialized coating painted on surfaces for protection against fire. The paint in question is specially designed to:<br> - Retard fire spread<br>- Maintain structural integrity: As a protective shield against fire and heat<br> - Meet safety requirements.<br> Fireproof paints typically contain specialized components that:<br> 1. Swell or expand with the application of heat <br>2. Provide thermal insulation.<br> Fireproof painting is extensively used in:<br> 1. Industrial complexes: Such as oil refineries, chemical plants, and power houses.<br> 2. Commercial complexes: Skyscrapers, shopping malls, and other structures wherein fire protection is essential. <br>3. Steel frames.</p>

							<div class="service-column" id="airless">
								<h2>Airless Spray Painting of Steel items</h2>
								<p>Airless spray painting is a process by which steel products are sprayed with paint.Airless spray painting utilizes a pump to pressurize paint, and then it is pushed through an extremely small nozzle and forms a fine spray. It does not utilize compressed air, as with regular spray painting. <br>Benefits:<br> 1. Quick application.<br>2. Thicker coats<br> 3. Smooth finish<br> 4. Protection against corrosion<br> 5. Durability<br> 6. Efficiency</p>
							</div>
							<div class="service-column" id="epoxy">
								<h2>Epoxy Painting</h2>
								<p>Epoxy paint is a type of paint that utilizes epoxy resin as the main component. The following are the features of epoxy paint: Key Characteristics:<br> -Epoxy paint has high resistance to wear and tear, chemicals, and abrasion. <br>- Adhesion: The epoxy paint has good adhesion to different surfaces such as metal, concrete, and wood.<br> - Chemical resistance: The paint based on epoxy is chemically resistant to many acids, bases, and solvents.<br>- Glossy finish: Epoxy paint can give a glossy finish that is not only visually appealing but also easy to clean.<br> Uses:<br> 1. Industrial floors are typically coated with epoxy paint, which is a chemical-resistant and durable coating.<br> 2. Steel structures<br> 3. Marine applications

											<h2>Quality Control and inspection</h2>
					<div class="quality-info">

					<p>
						Continuous check-up is carried out to ensure the requirement of BS EN ISO 1461:2009 and ASTM A123.<br>

						•	If requested by our client, we weigh the article before and after dipping to find the weight per area on sample items.<br>
						•	Sample Batching Test by magnetic film thickness gauge is carried out to check on the coating thickness.<br>
						•	Adhesion: Knife-test/ Pivot hammer is carried to the satisfaction of the client.
